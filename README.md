# COSMOSAC-ML
This is the official implementation of "Bridging Machine Learning and COSMO-SAC for Accurate Prediction of Infinite Dilute Activity Coefficients of Binary Mixtures". In this study, we  integrate COSMO-SAC with machine learning (ML) deliver accurate infinite dilution activity coefficient (IDAC) predictions for binary mixtures. A multi task ML model rapidly predicts σ profiles and VCOSMO, eliminating the need for QM calculations, and the COSMO SAC parameters are re optimized using more than 20 000 experimental IDAC data points. Residual systematic errors are further corrected with a boosting ensemble. The resulting hybrid COSMO SAC–ML workflow reduces the mean absolute error from 0.944 to 0.102 (R² = 0.969), representing an 89 % improvement, while preserving the model’s physicochemical interpretability. This accurate and efficient approach broadens the practical applicability of COSMO-SAC calculations and IDAC predictions, facilitating high throughput solvent screening for diverse chemical engineering applications.
